# Media
My favorite TV shows are Community, Breaking Bad, and Better Call Saul. I haven't watched new movies in a *looooong* time. Most of my media consumption is through YouTuve, especially STEM/maker creators.

# Food
Yes. Specifically cheese and chocolate.

# Code
Unsurprisingly, <code>I like code.</code> <br>
TypeScript >>> JavaScript (don't @ me)
